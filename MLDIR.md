## ðŸ“œ The MLDir Manifesto

â–¡ Each question should be in a separate directory

â–¡ If multiple questions use common processing then that processing should be in a single separate directory.

â–¡ Logic should be in .py files; meanwhile, notebooks are purely for demonstration and running entire pipelines. 

â–¡ Each question must have a single notebook that demonstrates the data science cycle for it


â–¡ Any notebook cell should be preced with a clear heading that describes what it does.

â–¡ Similar or related visualizations should be grouped together in the same figure whenever possible.
